# GameLink

This repo contains a C++ library that provides access to Muxyâ€™s GameLink API. The library is distributed as a single-file, header-only library for ease of integration.

## Integrating the library

The repo contains a pre-compiled version of the single header library in the root of the project, `gamelink_single.hpp`. You may also compile the library from source by using the CMake project target `amalgam` to generate the library header file.

## Documentation

The library is documented using in-line Doxygen-style comments in `include/gamelink.h`. A distributable form of the documentation can be built using Doxygen and Sphinx.

## Configuration

Near the top of `gamelink_single.hpp` there are two configuration macros, `MUXY_GAMELINK_CUSTOM_STRING_TYPE` and
`MUXY_GAMELINK_CUSTOM_LOCK_TYPE` that can be defined to modify the string and lock types used by the C++ library.
The inline documentation describes the required methods and behaviors that the string and lock types must satisfy.

## Testing

The test suite can be built through the CMake target `tests`.

If libcurl and libwebsockets are availiable, the tests suite will also build the integration tests. To run the integration tests,
generate a valid JWT and run the tests binary with the environment variables MUXY_INTEGRATION_JWT and MUXY_INTEGRATION_ID with the
test filter "[integration]"

### Building Test Suite on Mac

If you are building on a macOS device with a homebrew installed version of OpenSSL, you will have to specify the paths to the libraries:

```
rm -rf build \
  && mkdir -p build \
  && cd build \
  && cmake .. -GNinja -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl -DOPENSSL_LIBRARIES=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/lib \
  && cd ..

cmake --build build --target tests

```
